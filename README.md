Patch Antennas
--------------

Mostly for GPS and Wifi. Finding and proofing other people's, then desiging some of my own. 

The antenna designs that are not mine are the property of their owners. I'm getting them out of scientific publications and reproducing them here is just to facilitate reproducing the results. 

My own designs as well as all my implementation files are available under CERN's Open Hardware License, which intends to be "to hardware what the General Public Licence (GPL) is to software. It defines the conditions under which a licensee will be able to use or modify the licensed material. The concept of ‘open-source hardware’ or ‘open hardware’ is not yet as well known or widespread as the free software or open-source software concept. However, it shares the same principles: anyone should be able to see the source (the design documentation in case of hardware), study it, modify it and share it."
